# Travel Booking Website
About: 
- Full-stack development project using MEAN stack architecture for Full-Stack course. The website allows customers to search for and book trips, and create and sign into their account to check their itineraries. This project also includes an admin single-page application using Angular to run data inside the browser instead of on the server.


# Technical Components and Details:

Architecture:
- Express HTML as a web application framework that contains routes, controllers, views, and data models. This creates a web server and directory structure for the Node.js platform that allows better testing and scalability of web development tasks.
- JavaScript as the language used to run the webpage, especially with the Angular component. This was a requirement of the project. However, note this creates problems when search engines are involved. This is because search engines do not run all of the JavaScript for a website, therefore, there is a risk that data on a website that is JavaScript dependent will not be indexed by search engines.
- Angular used to create the administrator SPA functionality, which allows the website’s admin-view to run data inside of the browser instead of on the server. This reduces the amount of resources required from the server, thus, reducing the latency of the server and user experience each time an admin interacts with the data. 

Database: 
- NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend to store and feed data, such as a customer’s booked trip, to the front-end or user interface.

Functionality:
- Utilized JSON to create a static framework and mock up of the website. This is an example of refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiency, because it saved me time from figuring out the technicality of how to connect all of the components of the web development upfront.
- Javascript utilizes the JSON static files and incorporates the data with the other components of the MEAN stack to create a functioning website. 

Testing:
- Methods, such as GET and PUT, are used with data in the database to test the software’s architecture for functionality, reliability, and security. This type of testing does not rely on manual input testing but, rather, uses software to manipulate data and make calls to one or more API endpoints, and then compares the outputs of these calls with the expected results. 

Reflection:
- This course taught me how to create a full-stack development using the MEAN architecture. This is beneficial to help me achieve my goal of being a full-stack developer.
