# Full Stack II CS 470 Final Reflection

# Experiences and Strengths
- The skills that I learned in this course to help me become a more marketable candidate in my career field are:
  - How and when to utilize the Docker and Lambda containerization models.
  - How to migrate a full stack application to an AWS serverless solution using services such as S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM.
- My strengths as a software developer are my problem-solving skills and developing and finding solutions in a logical manner.
- The types of roles that I am prepared to assume in a new job are software developer, QA, and full-stack developer. 

# Planning for Growth
- I would handle errors by ensuring that testing is scheduled into the development and migration plans for each development and migration milestone, along with clear details of success criteria for each plan. Then, I would ensure that these test plans are executed and there is a report of their results.
- I would handle scaling by, first, noting the starting budget and capacity required for each resource. Then, I would create a scaling plan that includes projected capacity need and cost requirement per resource, metrics to determine usage and expenses, and a schedule of the frequency to review usage, expenses, and future scaling efforts (such as monthly, quarterly, etc.)
- I would predict the cost of future usage by reviewing previous predictions versus actual usage, the delta between these two variables (waste), future growth goals, and the resources and cost required to achieve these goals.
- Containers are more cost predictable because you pay a set amount upfront. Serverless is based on a per-usage model, so you only pay for the amount of usage that is actually used. This means that this model contains more variables, thus, creating less of a fixed cost.
- Several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion are an evaluation between a need versus want for the expansion, and the return on investment of the expansion. In other words, there is a greater chance for expansion if there is both a need to do so to meet demands and when the benefits outweigh the costs of the expansion.
- Elasticity and pay-for-service play important roles in the decision making for planned future growth. Elasticity helps ensures that resources are obtained on a per-need basis, and then released when they are done being utilized. This structure becomes cost-effective when coupled with the pay-for-service model. This model allows users to pay for only the resources and usages that they need. Not only is this model cost-effective, but it also ensures that resources are not going to waste.
