CS-465 full stack development with MEAN

# Architecture:

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA)
- Express HTML is a web application framework that contains routes, controllers, views, and data models. Essentially, it creates a web server and directory structure for the Node.js platform that allows developers to better test and scale the web development tasks.
- JavaScript is the language that is used to run the webpage, especially with the Angular component. This creates problems when search engines are involved. This is because search engines do not run all of the JavaScript for a website, therefore, there is a risk that data on a website that is JavaScript dependent will not be indexed by search engines.
- Angular, more specifically, is used to create the administrator SPA functionality, which allows the website’s admin-view to run data inside of the browser instead of on the server. This reduces the amount of resources required from the server, thus, reducing the latency of the server and user experience each time an admin interacts with the data. 

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
- In order to store and feed data, such as a customer’s booked trip, to the front-end or user interface.


# Functionality:

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
- JSON is beneficial to the development by allowing developers to create a static framework and mock up of the website.
- Javascript is primarily used to run the webpage, especially with the Angular component.
- Javascript utilizes the JSON static files and incorporates the data with the other components of the MEAN stack to create a functioning website. 

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
- Starting the development with JSON so that I was able to create a blueprint of the development and a static website, without having to spend a lot of time figuring out the technicality of how to connect all of the components of the web development upfront. 

# Testing:

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
- Methods, such as GET and PUT, are used with data in the database to test the software’s architecture for functionality, reliability, and security. This type of testing does not rely on manual input testing but, rather, uses software to manipulate data and make calls to one or more API endpoints, and then compares the outputs of these calls with the expected results.


# Reflection:

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
- This course taught me how to create a full-stack development using the MEAN architecture. This is beneficial to help me achieve my goal of being a full-stack developer.
